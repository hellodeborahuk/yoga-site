## About the project

I'm recreating my yoga website that I had previously created in WordPress. I wanted a project that would allow me to learn about Firebase. To begin with I've tested it with sample blog posts but I plan on creating a booking system for the website.

## Technologies used

* Next.js
* HTML/CSS
* Firebase

## Roadmap

1. Create a booking system
2. Add contact form
